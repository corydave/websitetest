Hey how's it going security people uh&nbsp;
this week we're doing chapter 4 so this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.920
is an information in cryptography there is&nbsp;
a bespoke code for you to break in chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.160
4 so make sure you look at the list because&nbsp;
the list is going to have um different names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.240
and different codes each one is unique to you&nbsp;
other than that I think almost everything's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.800
been graded uh maybe some things came in the&nbsp;
last day or so and I haven't looked at those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.480
yet but it it looks like people are doing well&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.000
you're having fun I hope you're having fun&nbsp;
uh but at least people are exploring and uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840

A simple, elegant PHP application for collecting and displaying rating survey results.

## Features

- âœ¨ Clean, responsive design with shadow effects
- ðŸŽ¨ Uses #0046ad as the primary brand color
- â™¿ Accessible markup with ARIA labels
- ðŸ“Š Animated bar chart results
- ðŸ“± Mobile-friendly responsive layout

## Files Included

- `index.php` - Main voting page with 1-10 number selection

   ```bash
   chmod 664 data.json
   ```

   - User sees numbers 1-10 in circular buttons
   - Clicks to select a number
   - Submit button appears with fade-in animation
   - Submits to vote.php

2. **Vote Processing** (`vote.php`):
   - Validates the submitted rating
   - Updates vote counts in data.json
   - Redirects to results page

3. **Results Page** (`results.php`):
   - Shows total response count
   - Displays bar chart for each number (1-10)
   - Bars animate in with smooth transitions
   - Link to vote again

## Customization

### Colors
To change the primary color from #0046ad, update in `styles.css`:
- Search for `#0046ad` and replace with your color
- Also update `#003a8f` (hover state) to a darker shade

### Design
- Box shadows are defined in `.survey-box` and `.results-box`
- Border radius is set to 12px for containers, 25px for buttons
- Number circles are 60px on desktop, 50px on mobile

## Data Storage

Votes are stored in `data.json` in this format:
```json
{
    "total": 33,
    "votes": {
        "1": 0,
        "2": 1,
        "3": 3,
        ...
    }
}
```

### Resetting Data
To reset all votes, replace data.json contents with:
```json
{
    "total": 0,
    "votes": {
        "1": 0,
